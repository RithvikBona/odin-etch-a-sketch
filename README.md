The Odin Project - Etch-a-Sketch Project

Website: https://rithvikbona.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/

This project is meant to showcase my Javascript and CSS skills in order to create
an Etch-a-Sketch. This has multiple modes: a basic pen that you can change the
color of, an eraser, a rainbow mode that uses HSL and the Golden Ratio to create
randomly visually appealing colors that have even spacing. Also included is a
darken and lighten mode, which adds or subtracts from the RGB value of a box to darken or lighten the box respectively.

I learned about toggling classes, about manipulating colors in different styles (RGB, HSL) and conversion between them, and how to randomly create asthetic colors that are evenly spaced. I
also learned about using onmousover in conjuction with a mousedown listener to create a drag
mouse to paint effect.
